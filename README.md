## Introduction
From October 2018 to May 2019, I will be doing my master research at the BESIII Collaboration as a visiting master student from Utrecht University (The Netherlands). Because I, like many others, will spend a lot of time getting used to the `BOSS` framework, I decided to supply the code I write for my own analysis with `Doxygen` formated comments. The resulting documentation can then be used as a gudie for anyone who wants to get familiar with the `BOSS` framework.

In writing my code, I have attempted to set up an object-oriented `C++` class structure that is both general in usage (that is, using base and derived classes) and represents the data structure of analysis output from the `BOSS` framework. In this way, I hope that class documentation in this repository can also be used to help the user understand the `BOSS` framework itself.
