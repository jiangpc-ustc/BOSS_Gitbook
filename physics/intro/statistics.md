# Statistics

* By far, the most comprehensive overview of statistical procedures in an experiment comparable to BESIII is the document [_Recommended Statistical Procedures for BaBar_](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/Statistics/Report/report.pdf)_._
* For a more theoretical treatment of statistic in high-energy physics, see section ["39. Statistics" in the PDG \(2018\)](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/reviews/rpp2018-rev-statistics.pdf).
