Documentation
=============

This folder is used by Doxygen as output folder for the `html` files. It currently also contains the subfolder `doxygen` where some Markdown files are located. Since I plan to split up the main `README.md` file into different tutorials, this subfolder might be moved to the root directory of the repository.
