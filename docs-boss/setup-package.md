# Set up a BOSS package

## How to set up a BOSS package?

Now that you have configured your **BOSS** work area, you can start developing packages. In theory, you can start from scratch. We'll have a short look at that procedure here, because it gives some insight into the default structure of a package in CMT.

### Structure of a default CMT package

As explained in [The BOSS Analysis Framework](intro.md), BOSS is organised through packages. Packages are components of the entire BOSS framework on which individuals like you work independently. Each package on itself can have several versions that are maintained by you through CMT.

To create an empty package \(with a default format\), use the following command:

```bash
cmt create MyFirstPackage MyFirstPackage-00-00-01
```

Here, the name `MyFirstPackage` is just an example name of the package. The name will be used as the folder name as well. The second string is the so-called _tag_ of the package. Within BESIII, [the convention is that the tag is just the package name followed by 6 digits](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/How_to_tag_a_package): `-<major id>-<minor id>-<patch id>`. These digits should increase along with changes you make. Increase the:

* `patch id` if you only made some simple bug fixes that don't change the interface \(`.h` header file\);
* `minor id` if you only made changes that are backward compatible, such as new functionality;
* `major id` if you modified the interface \(header file\) that require you to completely recompile the package.

The above only becomes relevant as when you start developing packages, so you can forget about this for now.

The result of the above command is a new folder, that we'll navigate into:

```bash
cd MyFirstPackage/MyFirstPackage-00-00-01
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that the folder structure `MyFirstPackage/MyFirstPackage-00-00-01` is **required** for `cmt` to work properly within BOSS. If you don't have a subfolder with a string for the version as above, `cmt broadcast` won't work!
{% endhint %}

Within this folder, you see the core of a default CMT package:

* **`cmd`**: a folder that contains all files necessary for administration of the package through CMT. There are 6 files:
  * **`cleanup.csh`**

    This is a `tcsh` script that allows you to clean all installation files of the package \(for instance useful when you are moving to a new version\).

  * **`cleanup.sh`** The same as `cleanup.csh`, but than in `bash` shell script format.
  * **`Makefile`**  A file that is necessary for compilation through `make`/`cmake`/`gmake`.
  * **`requirements`**

    The most important of file! Here, you define which other packages within BOSS your own package requires \(it defines the _dependencies_\).  
    You can have a closer look at this file for the `TestRelease` example package or on [this page](http://polywww.in2p3.fr/activites/physique/glast/workbook/pages/cmtMRvcmt/cmtIntroduction.htm#requirementsFile) to see how this file is ordinarily formatted.

  * **`setup.csh`**  Another important file. It is used when 'broadcasting' your package.
  * **`setup.sh`**: the same, but now in `bash` shell script format.
* **`src`**: an empty folder that will hold your `c++` source code \(`.cxx` files\). Optionally, corresponding headers of these files are usually placed in a folder called `share` but this folder is not generated by default.

For more information see [this nice introduction to CMT](http://polywww.in2p3.fr/activites/physique/glast/workbook/pages/cmtMRvcmt/cmtIntroduction.htm).

### Additional files you should create

In addition to the default files above, it is advised that you also create the following files/directories:

* A subdirectory with the name of your package. In our case, it should be called `MyFirstPackage`.
* A subdirectory named`test`. You use this for private testing of your package.
* A subdirectory named`doc` for documentation files.
* A subdirectory named`share` for platform-independent configuration files, scripts, etc.
* A file named `README` that briefly describes the purpose and context of the package.
* A file named `ChangeLog` that contains a record of the changes.

The above is based on the [official BOSS page on how to create a new package](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/How_to_create_a_new_package) \(minimal explanations\).

### Updating a package

{% hint style="warning" %}
**@todo** Test the below procedure.
{% endhint %}

Whenever you modify the code in your package \(particularly the header code in the `MyFirstPackage` and the source code in `src`\), you need to 'update' the package. This is done through the following commands:

```bash
cmt config      # let CMT know that you are updating
make            # build executables from the source code
source setup.sh # create the update
```

### Tagging a new version of your package



~~In conjuncture with CVS, CMT now decides how to tag the new version of the package. Usually, this means that the patch id number is incremented by one. \(Whether this properly follows the~~ [~~BESIII version naming convention~~](setup-package.md#structure-of-a-default-cmt-package) ~~is not entirely clear.\)~~

{% hint style="info" %}
BESIII has some documentation on working with CMT available [here](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Getting_Started). It seems, however, that you need special admission rights to CVS to successfully perform these steps. The documentation is therefore probably outdated.
{% endhint %}

### Adding packages to BOSS

{% hint style="warning" %}
**@todo** Go through Chinese documentation and [this page](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Getting_Started) and write out.

**Note**: It seems special access rights are needed for this procedure, so I have currently not been able to test these procedures.
{% endhint %}

## Example packages

Within BOSS, there are already a few 'example' packages available. All of these are accessible through the so-called [`TestRelease` package](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Afterburner/tree/master/boss/workarea/TestRelease), which will be described and set up first. We then focus on one of its main dependencies: the [RhopiAlg algorithm](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Afterburner/tree/master/boss/workarea/Analysis/Physics/RhopiAlg). Within BESIII, this package is typically used as an example for selecting events and usually forms the start of your research.

### The `TestRelease` package

The `TestRelease` package is used to run certain basic packages that are already available within BOSS. It is best if you copy it into your [your work area](../#set-up-your-work-area), so you can play around with it. A slightly updated version of the `TestRelease` is already available in the BOSS Afterburner in the [`boss/workarea` folder](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Afterburner/tree/master/boss/workarea).

You can also choose to copy it from its location in BOSS:

```bash
/afs/ihep.ac.cn/bes3/offline/Boss/$BOSSVERSION/TestRelease
```

If you [set up your BOSS environment](setup.md#2-set-up-your-boss-workarea) correctly, you can copy `TestRelease` to your _BOSS workarea_ as follows:

```bash
cp â€“r "$BesArea/TestRelease" "$BOSSWORKAREA"
cd "$BOSSWORKAREA/TestRelease/TestRelease-"*
```

You are now in the folder `TestRelease/TestRelease-00-00-86`. Using `ls`, you can see that it contains the following folders:

* `cmt`: the _Configuration Management Tool_ that you will use to connect to **BOSS**
* `CVS`: a folder used for version management.
* `run`: which contains the `jobOptions` that are run with `boss.exe`

We can set up the `TestRelease` by going into `cmt` and 'broadcasting' to **BOSS** from there:

```bash
cd cmt
cmt broadcast      # connect your workarea to BOSS
cmt config         # perform setup and cleanup scripts
cmt broadcast make # build and connect executables to BOSS
source setup.sh    # set bash variables
```

The term `broadcast` is important here and makes the status of the `TestRelease` package different than for instance the `RhopiAlg`.

We have now initialised the package, so that you can run it in BOSS from the `run` folder. This is done using `boss.exe`:

```bash
cd ../run
boss.exe jobOptions_sim.txt
```

which, in this case, will run a Monte Carlo simulation.

Note that in [Step 5 when we set up the work area](setup.md#step-5-modify-your-bashrc) we added `source setup.sh` line to the `.bashrc` that ensures that the `TestRelease` package is loaded every time you log in, so you won't have to do this every time yourself.

### The `Rhopi` algorithm

One of the basic analysis packages that is already provided in BOSS is the `RhopiAlg` package. Within BESIII, almost everyone knows it, because it is used as the starting point for developing your own packages. `RhopiAlg` is an illustration of a typical procedure in particle physics: selecting events from your data or Monte Carlo simulation.

The `RhopiAlg` package is located here:

```bash
/afs/ihep.ac.cn/bes3/offline/Boss/$BOSSVERSION/Analysis/Physics/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg-00-00-23
```

A [better commented version](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Afterburner/tree/master/boss/workarea/Analysis/Physics/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg-00-00-23) is also available within the BOSS Afterburner. In this tutorial, we will work with this version.

Only need to \(as opposed to `TestRelease`\):

```bash
cmt config
make
source setup.sh
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**@todo** Describe `RhopiAlg` and how to work with it.

1. Aim \(physics\)
2. What this will teach you: - `fit4c` versus `fit5c` - Different output
3. **Note**: Focus on structure of the package and of the code. How to run it is explained in [Running jobs](running-jobs.md).
