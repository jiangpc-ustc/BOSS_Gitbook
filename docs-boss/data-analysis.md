# Data analysis

## Data from Monte Carlo simulations

### Your own simulations

### Simulations performed by BESIII

## Data from measurements

## Analysis using the BOSS Afterburner

From here on, you will essentially be doing your own research. Most types of data analysis in particle physics, however, have much in common, particularly within the same collaboration. This is why the BOSS Afterburner has been made public: it can serve as a starting point for your own research.

We therefore come to the second part of this GitBook.
