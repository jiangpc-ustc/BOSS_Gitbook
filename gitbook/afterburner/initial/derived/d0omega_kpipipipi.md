# D0omega\_Kpipipipi

## Physics

Analyses the decay:

$$
J/\psi \rightarrow D^0\omega \rightarrow K^-\pi^+ \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0
$$

This is a rare decay \(note the violation of conservation of strangeness\). In addition, this decay is of the form $$J/\psi \rightarrow \text{PV}$$, where $$\text{P}$$ stands for _pseudoscalar meson_ and $$\text{V}$$ stands for _vector meson_. Decays of this type can serve as a test for different beyond the Standard Model models, because these predict certain branching ratios for this type of decay. Inspiration for this decay channel comes from [arXiv:1402.4025](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4025).
