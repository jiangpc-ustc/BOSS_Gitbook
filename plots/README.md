Plots folder
============

This folder is used as output folder for e.g. invariant mass plots with fits. They are empty in the repository, as `pdf`, `png`, `eps` files etc. are excluded by `.gitignore`.

Currently, I have also added some scripts to this folder. The difference between the ones here and the ones in the `scripts` folder is that these are supposed to be more 'object-oriented', i.e., making use of the classes defined in `inc` folder.
