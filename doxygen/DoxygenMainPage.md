Doxygen pages of the BOSS Afterburner repository {#mainpage}
============================================================

This is the class documenation of the *BOSS Afterburner* repository. These pages are meant to help make sense of the class structure of both the event selection packages (subalgorithms of `TrackSelector`) and of the scripts that are used to analyse output of BOSS.

A good start is to have a look at the [Class Hierarchy](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_Afterburner/hierarchy.html).

For the tutorial pages on BOSS and the *BOSS Afterburner*, go to the [GitBook page of this repository](https://besiii.gitbook.io/boss-gitbook). For the repository itself, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Afterburner).
