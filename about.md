# About

From October 2018 to May 2019, I will be doing my master research at the BESIII Collaboration as a visiting master student from Utrecht University \(The Netherlands\). Because I, like many others, will spend a lot of time getting used to the **BOSS** framework, I decided to supply the code I write for my own analysis with `Doxygen` formated comments. The resulting documentation can then be used as a guide for anyone who wants to get familiar with the **BOSS** framework.

In writing my code, I have attempted to set up an object-oriented `C++` class structure that is both general in usage \(that is, using _base and derived classes_\) and represents the data structure of analysis output from the **BOSS** framework. In this way, I hope that the class documentation in this repository can also be used to help the user understand the **BOSS** framework itself.
