# Glossary

## B

### BEPC

Beijing Electron-Positron Collider

### BESIII

Beijing Electron Spectrometer III

### BOSS

BESIII Offline Software System

## C

### CAS

[Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.cas.cn/)

## E

### Exclusive Monte Carlo simulation

You only generate events with decays that are of interest to your analysis.

## I

### IHEP

[Institute of High Energy Physics](http://english.ihep.cas.cn/), part of the [Chinese Academy of Science](glossary.md#cas)

### Inclusive Monte Carlo simulation

You generate event as completely as possible. Since this takes a lot of computing resources, one usually makes use of the data sets that were reconstructed by the BOSS team for your version of BOSS. For the file locations of inclusive $$J/\psi$$ samples, see [this page](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Jpsi_data) \[requires login\].

## S

Semantic versioning

See [here](https://semver.org/). This is essentially a numbering scheme used for tagging versions of a package. Within BOSS, a package can for instance be given tag `Package-01-04-03`, where `01` is the major ID, `04` the minor ID, and `03` the patch ID.

## U

### UCAS

[University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/)
