## BEPC

Beijing Electron-Positron Collider

## BESIII

Beijing Electron Spectrometer III

## Exclusive Monte Carlo simulation

You only generate events with decays that are of interest to your analysis.

## CAS

[Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.cas.cn/)

## IHEP

[Institute of High Energy Physics](http://english.ihep.cas.cn/), part of the [Chinese Academy of Science](glossary.md#cas)

## Inclusive Monte Carlo simulation

You generate event as completely as possible. Since this takes a lot of computing resources, one usually makes use of the data sets that were reconstructed by the BOSS team for your version of BOSS. For the file locations of inclusive $$J/\psi$$ samples, see [this page](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Jpsi_data) \[requires login\].
