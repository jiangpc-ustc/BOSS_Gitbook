Data folder
====================

Output of the BOSS framework can be written to this folder. Have a look at the `jobOptions*.txt` templates in the `jobs` folder to see why it is necessary that this folder already exists.

You can also write the data to `scratchfs`, which has more space. See [Organisation of the IHEP server](https://besiii.gitbook.io/boss/docs-boss/ihep-server).

This folder is indeed empty in the Git repository, but for some subfolders, because the contents are shielded by `.gitignore`.
