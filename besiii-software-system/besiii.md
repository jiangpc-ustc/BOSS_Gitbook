The [Beijing Spectrometer \(BESIII\)](http://bes3.ihep.ac.cn/) is a particle detector experiment situated at the [Beijing Electron-Positron Collider \(BEPCII\)](http://english.ihep.cas.cn/doc/1840.html). It is primarily designed to perform studies of charmonium and charm physics, light hadrons, determination of the tau mass, and $$R$$ scans at a center-of-mass energy of ranging between 2 to 5 GeV.
